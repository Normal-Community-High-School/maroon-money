      Financial aid is an important way to help you pay for college. It might come from federal or state levels, private sources, or the school itself. According to Education Data Initiative, "83.8% of college students benefit from some form of financial aid," and that number grows each year. Here is some brief information to help you understand the meaning of financial aid terminology and determine which forms of aid might be relevant to you.
Loans
Loans are simple: you are given money that you must repay, usually with interest. Federal student loans are a common and important source of aid.
Grants
As long as you fulfill your obligations, you don't have to repay grant money. Examples include Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants.
Work-study jobs
Federal programs that pay your college fees in exchange for your part-time work.
Other
There is also aid you can obtain for more specific reasons, such as Military Family Aid and International Study Aid. Look into which types of aid are most likely to benefit you, as this page doesn't detail every type that's available.
Scholarships
Scholarships come from nonprofit or private organizations. Students receive them based on their talents or their academic/athletic abilities. There are also scholarships given according to characteristics, such as ethnicity or whether you're a first generation college student.
You can find information about scholarships by contacting a school's counselors or financial aid office.
Illinois Financial Aid
The source used in the preface states that, of the 50 states, Illinois spends the 12th most money on student financial aid, nearly $400 million annually. That's $1,131 per undergraduate student, on average. Student loans are much more popular among attendees of 4-year institutions in Illinois than 2-year.      </Text>
